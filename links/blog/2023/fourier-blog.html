<h2 id="what-is-fourier-series-and-how-it-came-to-be">What is fourier
    series and how it came to be?</h2>
    <p>The Fourier series is a mathematical concept which was developed by
    the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Fourier in the early 19th
    century. He engraved his name in the mathematics hall of fame with the
    groundbreaking discovery of Fourier series.</p>
    <p>Fourier's key insight was that any function could be decomposed into
    a sum of sine and cosine waves with different amplitudes and
    frequencies. This discovery laid the foundation many areas science like
    physics, telecommunication etc.</p>
    <p>Fourier derived a formula which is now known as the Fourier series
    which provides a systematic way of expressing any function (provided it
    matches dilichet's <sup>1</sup></a> conditions) as an infinite sum of
    sines and cosines.</p>
    <p>All of this is quite a bit to understand just through words, so lets
    look at a small animation which will help us understand a bit easier.
    (This animation was taken from 3b1b's video on this very topic. Wtach
    the video after reading this!)</p>
    <p><strong><strong>Add gif here</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Pretty cool right!? Now lets take a look at the maths.</p>
    <h3 id="the-formula">The formula</h3>
    <p>According to the statement lets consider a function <span
    class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> with a period <span
    class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> defined on an interval <span
    class="math inline">[−<em>π</em>,<em>π</em>]</span>. Then the fourier
    series rerpresentation of <span
    class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is given by: <span
    class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> + ∑[<em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>cos<em>n</em><em>ω</em><em>t</em>+<em>b</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>sin<em>n</em><em>ω</em><em>t</em>]</span></p>
    <p>where</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a<sub>0</sub> is the constant term</li>
    <li><span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> and
    <span class="math inline"><em>b</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> are
    called fourier and <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is a
    positive integer</li>
    <li><span class="math inline"><em>ω</em></span> is the fundamental
    frequency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="section"></h2>
    <h3 id="calculating-fourier-coefficients-and-the-constant">Calculating
    Fourier coefficients and the constant</h3>
    <p>The fourier coefficients can be found using these formulae: <span
    class="math display">$$a_{0} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}f(x)
    dt$$</span></p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}
    \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\cos{nx}dx$$</span></p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}
    f(x)\sin{nx}dx$$</span></p>
    <p>Where <span class="math inline">∀ <em>n</em> ∈ <em>N</em></span></p>
    <h3 id="breaking-down-the-math">Breaking down the math</h3>
    <p>Looking at the statement we can very easily understand how the
    formula came to be.</p>
    <p>As we know, a Fourier series is a decomposition of a function into
    sine and cosine waves, and the sum of these waves of different
    frequencies uptill infinity very closely represents the original
    function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>, thus
    the term "<span class="math display">$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$$</span>"
    which means sum of all terms for <span
    class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 1</span> to infinity.</p>
    <p>Obviously there is no such thing as <em>infinite</em>, but the more
    number of terms you add the closer it represents to the original
    function, so <em>tending</em> to infinity.</p>
    <p>Now the coefficients are what decide the frequency and amplitude of
    each of the waves. Now the constant term <span
    class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the average of all
    the outputs of the function over the certain interval, yeilding equation
    <span class="math inline">$a_{0} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}f(x)
    dt$</span>.</p>
    <p>If we break this down into <span
    class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> into the sums again
    and integrate individual terms, there will be only one term whose
    integral will be a constant number and all others will be 0. This one
    constant term is <span
    class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub></span>.</p>
    <p>Wow if we multiply <span
    class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> by some other term,
    and then repeat the above step again, then some nth term will be the
    constant term, which is actually $a<sub>n</sub>$! Here we are
    multiplying each term with a sine wave, Thus the equation: <span
    class="math display">$$a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}
    \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin{nx}dx$$</span>.</p>
    <p>And similarly we can also calculate <span
    class="math inline"><em>b</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>.</p>
    <p>Lets understand this better by solving a question. Consider the
    following function.</p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
    -k &amp; \text{when } -\pi &lt; x &lt; 0 \\
    +k &amp; \text{when } 0 &lt; x &lt; \pi
    \end{cases}$$</span></p>
    <p>The graph of the function will look like this</p>
    <img src="assets/graph1.png" style="
    display:flex; align-items: center;
    margin: auto auto
    ">
    <p>Now we need to find the right sum of sines and cosines which will
    closely represent this function. First we need to find the constant
    <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub></span>. Let's use the
    formula</p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$a_{0} = \frac{1}{2 \pi}
    \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}f(x) dt$$</span></p>
    <p>Since this function is discontinious we can break it down into two,
    So from <span class="math inline"> − <em>π</em></span> to <span
    class="math inline">0</span> the value of the function f(x) will be
    <span class="math inline"> − <em>k</em></span> and from 0 to <span
    class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> it will be k, <span
    class="math inline">∴</span></p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$a_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi}[ \int_{-\pi}^{0}-k
    dx + \int_{0}^{\pi}k dx]$$</span></p>
    <p>Solving this integral we get the answer:</p>
    <p><span class="math display"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub> = 0</span></p>
    <p>To the keen eyes, this result was obvious, as <span
    class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the average value
    over the entire period, it is infact 0 in this case. Let's move on to
    calculating <span
    class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> now; Using
    the formula</p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}
    \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\cos{nx}dx$$</span></p>
    <p>Now break it down as before and solve the integral and we get:</p>
    <p><span
    class="math display"><em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = 0</span></p>
    <p>This means that there are no terms of cosine present in the Fourier
    series.</p>
    <p>Rpeating the same we find <span
    class="math inline"><em>b</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> and get the
    following result:</p>
    <p>Now we get two cases when n is odd and n is even, lets consider them
    individually.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Case 1: n is even</p>
    <p>When n is even and you substitute values you get 0, This means there
    are no even terms.</p></li>
    <li><p>Case2: n is odd</p>
    <p>When n is odd, we obtain this equation: <span
    class="math display">$$b_n = \frac{4k}{n\pi}$$</span> so for all odd
    values of n we get: <span class="math display">$$b_1 = \frac{4k}{\pi},\
    b_2 = \frac{4k}{3\pi},\ b_3= \frac{4k}{5\pi}$$</span> and so on.</p>
    <p>Substituting all the values in the original formula we get</p>
    <p><span class="math display">$$f(x) =0+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty }(0 + b_{n}
    \sin{nx})$$</span> <span class="math inline">∴</span> we can say, <span
    class="math display">$$f(x) = \frac{4k}{\pi} (\sin{x} +
    \frac{1}{3}\sin{3x} + \frac{1}{5}\sin{5x}+....)$$</span></p>
    <p>Now if we plot this function against the original graph we get
    this:</p>
    <img src="assets/desmos-graph.png" id="graphs" style="
    margin:auto auto;
    scale: 70%;
    ">
    <p>red line: original function black line: calculated function</p>
    <p>Hence we can say that any function <span
    class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> can be represented as
    a sum of sine and cosine waves.</p>
    <p>As we can see the function we just calculate is very close to what
    the original function looks.</p>
    <p>That's it for this blog, In this series, next blog I'll be probably
    covering Taylor's Series.</p>
