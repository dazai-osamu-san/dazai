      <h1>My Astrophotography Experience</h1>
      <p>Recently I’ve discovered the new hobby of astrophotograhpy, although i dont have a lot of the gear, i try to grab every opportunity to get a photo, recently one of those opportunities came by, I rented a camera and the lens and went to the location. This post Ill go through the process of taking these types of photos and what mistakes i made. (this was a first time experience for me too).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now, I myself am pretty new to this hobby, there are still heaps of things to explore here, also there is a whole lot of other equipment that i did not know about. This is an expensive hobby to get into, so it is my suggestion that you do decent amount of research and only then buy the necessary equipment. Also it is not always necessary that you need that specific piece of equipment to take a photo there are some alternatives.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some places where i took help from are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="">Astrobiscuit discord server</a>
        </li>

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJMZQgyP7Dc">Allyn Wallace's Video on this topic</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Now lets get into the nitty gritty.</p>

      <h1>Startrail Photo</h1>
      <div class="startrail">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684154912158-e73fa72705d0?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA==&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2972&q=80">
      </div>  
      <br>
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This photo was taken over 30 minutes (approx.). <br>
        Shutter speed: 20 seconds <br>
        ISO: 2000<br>
        F-stop: f/2.8. <br> 
        Camera used: Sony a7iii (non modified)<br>
        Lens used: Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8</p>
      <h2>Capturing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>- You will need a stable tripod to take this photo. Mount your camera on the tripod.<br></li>
        <li>- Now set the focus to manual, and set the composition of your photo. Now using the digital zoom feature on your camera zoom into the brighest star in the frame. Adjust the manual focus ring till the star is a nice crisp circular point.<br></li>
        <li>- Here you can do either of two things, take one big long exposure photo or take multiple photos over short span and stack them up later. I chose to do the second as the first method is too risky and the entire shot is ruined if a single person walks in.<br></li>
        <li>- You will want to now calculate how long the shutter speed is going to be. Now to set the shutter speed for this shot we will use the following formula<br><br>
          Shutter speed (sec.) = 500/focal length (mm) <br><br>
          <i><b>NOTE:</b></i> This formula is only applicable to full frame cameras, if you are using a crop sensor (APS-C) you will want to replace the 500 with 300.</li>
        <li>- Go to your camera settings and find the intervalometer or you can use an external intervalometer. It will keep taking the photos, set the time between to 1-2 seconds, do not exceed 4 seconds or you will start to have gaps in the photo.</li>
        <li>- Now make sure no one walks in the frame or the setup does not shake.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your camera supports it you will want to save the photos in Uncompressed RAWs. It will take up more space but you will end up with much better end result.<br><br>
        That is all!</p>
      <h2>Processing</h2>
      <p>At the end you should end up with a set of hundreds photos(depeding on how long you want it) . <br>
        Now we will open them in a post-processing software, Im a FOSS supporter and cant afford adobe so my choice will be darktable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- In darktable, import all the photos that are taken</li>
        <li>- go to any photo and make some minor changes according to your preference like increasing the shadows and or decreasing the lights and make sure to tick the lens correction section.</li>
        <li>- Save this as a style in the lighttable section. select all the photos and apply the style and export them to a new folder but in .tiff format.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next we are going to stack these photos, the software we are going to use is called “starStaX” go and download it from their site. After installing open the app and</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Drag and drop all the photos you want to stack in the left container. </li>
        <li>- On the right side we will select gap filling as the method. </li>
        <li>- In the top left you will see an option to start stacking. You will see it stack in live time. </li>
        <li>- Once the stacking is completed, go to the threshold slider and adjust it till all the star streaks are highilghted.</li>
        <li>- Now play around with the amount slider till you get the result you want. </li>
        <li>- Export the photo and you are done!</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <p>Now If you want to you can take this photo back to darktable to make more edits and if you think the foreground of the photo is over exposed or there are some issues in it you can go into gimp and follow these steps. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import both the photo as layers, now the photo you want the foreground of should be at the top. </li>
        <li>Use the free select tool and then select the foreground and then add a layer mask which will hide the sky from the layer resulting in the photo you want.</li>
      </ul>
